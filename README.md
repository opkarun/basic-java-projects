# üß† Basic Java Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-level Java projects! This repository is part of my learning journey as a first-semester engineering student at Chitkara University (CSE-AI), where I'm actively building foundational skills in Java, Python, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

Each project here is designed to reinforce core programming concepts through hands-on practice. I've included clear comments and structured logic to make the code readable and helpful for others who are learning too.

Please feel free to drop any suggestions and review my work as i am a beginner and any help would mean a lot.

## üöÄ Why This Repo Exists

As someone passionate about coding and community learning, I created this repository to:
- Practice and strengthen my Java fundamentals
- Document my progress through small, purposeful projects
- Share annotated code that others can learn from or build upon
